``lmno`` - An Embedded Programming Language
===========================================

|lmno| is an (experimental) programming language. It is implemented as an
C++ library, and can be compiled and executed by a modern C++20 compiler.

.. note::

   These docs, like |lmno| itself, are "experimental", and woefully incomplete.
   They will cover some aspects of |lmno| and the C++ library, but a lot remains
   undocumented.
