What does the name "|lmno|" mean?
#################################

The language itself is inspired by the style, grammar, and idioms of array
programming languages such as APL, BQN, J, etc. In fact, a huge number of
symbolic languages all have names that are single letters or initialisms.

So, what kind of letter/initialism could I come up with?

Obviously: Everyone's favorite "letter" in the English mnemonic alphabet song:
*Elemenoh*, or "L-M-N-O".

What does |lmno| "stand for"?

That is an excellent question.
